# Brande_CSCI2270_FinalProject
For my final project I'm going to create a gym reservation system. People will be able to schedule themselves in classes, if there are spots available, see the times and days classes are held and see how long the classes last. I will implement this using arrays and vectors where the array stores the set classes. The array will point to a vector containing the days of the week and times, read through a text file, and that vector will also point to the vector storing the names of people that are signed up for classes.

Use:
Download FinalProject.cpp FinalProject.h gymReservation.cpp and run through CodeBlocks, Sublime, or any functional development environment 
-I run the program through the terminal

Environment:
Can be used on Mac, or Windows or through the VM 


Open Bugs/Fixes:
-"Vendor Login" and "Add Classes" don't function properly
